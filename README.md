This app is the consolidation of all the in class and homework app’s assigned to students in 5180-Mobile App Development at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Each week students were assigned around 2 small android apps to code. This app opens to a ListView of all the apps that were assigned. The apps were added as the semester progressed and bugs were fixed based on feedback from the courses TA’s.
